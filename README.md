# Lack of EV Supercharger Sites at National Park Destinations

Our team of data analysts believe that there is a dirth of express charge point stations for the growing amount electic vehicles which will be used to travel to National Parks within the continental United States. Once those EVs have arrived for a day of recreation, will there be enough supercharger ports for all who visit to be able to return home with 24 hours or are other will other plans be required to stay overnight and slow charge through 220 volt outlets?

* Gather US EV sales data and unique charging stations data
* Research and gather Tesla Supercharger stations data
* Gather US National Parks locations, unique visitors per year, EV charging info, etc.
* ETL the dataframes
* Plot charts of relevant information
* Jsonify data for JS
* Leaflet/GeoJson mapping of data
* Produce slides and report
